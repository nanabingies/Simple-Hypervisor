# Simple Hypervisor

I've become very interested in virtualization and decided to develop my own hypervisor.

This is a very simple barebone type-2 hypervisor with no other advanced features. I'll be adding more features as I expand my knowledge base on the topic.

# Work In Progress

# Update
I'm currently in the processing of rewriting the entire codebase in c++. Will work on adding more features when I'm done.
